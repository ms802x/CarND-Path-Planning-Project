# Highway Driving Project
In this project, I will be using  C++ to program a path planning algorithm. The algorathem should know when to slow down, turn right or left, and speed up with minmum jerking. 

# Path Planning algorithm 

The algorithm should be built such that: 
- No collision
- It should always be in-lane and follow its direction 
- Maximum speed of 50 MPH 
- Maximum acceleration of 10 m/s²
- Maximum jerk of 10 m/s³

 **The motion control** of the algorathim can be thought of as the steering wheel. Its responsblity is to guide the car based on the output generated by the **Trajector Planner**. In **Sensor Fusion**, we utlize get the data from our radar and lidar sensor (as done in the Extended Kalman Filter project). **The Sensor Fusion output** is then fed to the localization(We have programmed it in the kidnapped viechle project) and the prediction layer of our algorthim. The **Behavior Layer**, suggest what next action should be. For example, if the there was car ahead, the **behavior planner** will suggest to pass this car by giving an applicable, safe, legal and efficient action. The execution of this suggestion is then taken car of by the **Trajector Planner**.
 
 The layers this project is concerned about are: 
 - Prediction
 - Behaviour planner
 - Trajector Planner 
 

### Reflection 
- ##### Prediction

    My code in the predction step loops through the data collected by the sensors which are s,d,vx and vy for each car.  Based on these data the predection should decide how should we behave like slow down? or change lanes?. Each lane is 4 meter wide, therefoer we will split define each car postion with lane index starts with 0 each 4d in fernert coordinate. If the car lane index matched our car lane postion it will set flag for slowing down. The other two flags are for other cars on the adjacent right and left lanes. The sepration distance between car was set at 30m for slowing dowm or lane changing.
    
- ##### Behavioral Planning 
    The Behavior Planner will take the flags state, and based upon them will suggest if we should speed up, slow down, or change lane and by what speed factor. 

- ##### Trajector Planner
    Lastly, the Trajector Planner, will take these suggestion provided by the Behavioral Planning and will excute them.
